# RogueAsteroid Project Charter

## Project Overview
RogueAsteroid is a modern interpretation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, developed as a collaborative project between a Designer (you) and an Engineer (me) using Python.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Designer (You)
- Define game mechanics and features
- Specify visual and audio aesthetics
- Create game balance specifications
- Define user experience and interface requirements
- Review and approve technical implementations
- Provide feedback on playability and feel
- Define success criteria for features
- Propose modifications and improvements

### Engineer (Me)
- Implement technical solutions based on design specifications
- Create and maintain code architecture
- Handle technical debugging and optimization
- Provide technical feasibility feedback
- Implement testing frameworks
- Document technical implementations
- Maintain code quality and organization
- Suggest technical alternatives when needed

## Working Methodology

1. **Design First Approach**
   - All features must start with a design specification
   - Designer must approve any significant technical decisions that affect gameplay
   - Engineer must validate technical feasibility of designs

2. **Communication Protocol**
   - Designer provides detailed specifications in design documents
   - Engineer asks clarifying questions when specifications are unclear
   - Both parties must agree on feature completion criteria
   - Regular review cycles for implemented features

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Design Documents (Designer)
     * Game Design Document (GDD)
     * Feature Specifications
     * UI/UX Requirements
     * Asset Specifications
   - Technical Documents (Engineer)
     * Technical Architecture
     * Implementation Details
     * Testing Documentation
     * Setup Instructions

4. **Change Management**
   - All significant changes must be documented
   - Designer must approve gameplay-affecting changes
   - Engineer must approve technical architecture changes
   - Both parties must agree on priority changes

## Success Criteria
- Game matches or exceeds original Asteroids gameplay feel
- Code is well-documented and maintainable
- Features are implemented according to design specifications
- Game performs smoothly and is bug-free
- Project follows established roles and responsibilities

## Version Control
- All design documents will be version controlled
- All code changes will be documented
- Design decisions will be tracked and documented

This charter serves as the foundation for our collaboration and can be amended as needed with mutual agreement.
